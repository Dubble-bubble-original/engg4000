# Meeting Notes

## [Sept 21, 2021] First Official Meeting
1h 20m
- Discussed Project Scope Document

- Initial project leader decided: Fred

## [Sept 23, 2021] Sprint 1 Planning
1h 20m
### Standup <!-- omit in toc -->
- Sahil: Initial react project done
- Carter: EC2 instance created
- Joao: MongoDB cluster created
- Nathaniel: Created initial Express & Karate projects
- Fred: Defined basic object structure & APIs
### Dicussions <!-- omit in toc -->
- Carter idea: in production, can add IP restriction (API only accept request from frontend IP)
### Decisions <!-- omit in toc -->
- Build the app as single-page app for now (maybe switch to react router later)
- Start with only "anonymous" messages (maybe add login later)
- First sprint starts now (Genesis) -> [Sept 27 - Oct 8]
- These meeting notes will be kept in a markdown file in the repo under Documentation folder
- Rough definition of the merging process:
  1. Pull request into `dev` branch
  1. At least 2 reviews
  1. Merge it (anyone can do it once has 2 reviews)
  1. At end of sprint, merge `dev` into `master` (triggers production deployment)
### Todo <!-- omit in toc -->
- UI meeting next thursday (bring your ideas!)
- Carter will create users for AWS (remember to activate 2 factor auth)

0h
### Standup <!-- omit in toc -->
- Sahil: 
- Carter: 
- Joao: 
- Nathaniel: 
- Fred: 
### Dicussions <!-- omit in toc -->
- Fred suggestions: 
  - add rule on github to delete branches once merged
  - future meeting notes updates will be commited directly to dev branch without pr & reviews
  - create separate Trello "Done" columns for each sprint
- How does the Trello board "Ready to test" column work?
